# Next.js 404 Error with Link Component

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where a 404 error occurs when navigating between pages using the `next/link` component.  The issue arises due to incorrect routing or missing pages. The provided solution details the troubleshooting and fixes.

## Bug Report

A Next.js application throws a 404 error when navigating to the `/about` page from the home page, even though the `about.js` file exists in the `pages` directory. The application is set up using the `next/link` component for navigation, which should handle routing seamlessly.

## Solution

The problem is resolved by ensuring that the page path specified in the `href` attribute of the `Link` component accurately matches the file path within the `pages` directory. It's crucial to double-check file names and directory structure for any inconsistencies.  Additionally, check if any server side routing configurations might be interfering.
